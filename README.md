# CarDiagnosis-Expert-System
ðŸ§° Car Diagnosis Expert System (Prolog)
A rule-based expert system designed to help users diagnose common car problems through interactive symptom-based questions. This AI project uses Prolog and implements backward chaining, simulating expert mechanic reasoning in a user-friendly format.

ðŸ’¡ Overview
This system asks a series of questions related to car symptoms and evaluates user input using logic-based rules to suggest possible diagnoses. Diagnoses are grouped by car system (e.g., Electrical, Cooling), with human-readable explanations.

ðŸ”§ Technologies
Prolog (SWI-Prolog recommended)
Logical reasoning (Backward Chaining)
Rule-based system
Dynamic fact assertion
ðŸš€ How to Run
Make sure you have SWI-Prolog installed. Then run:

swipl
?- [diagnosis].
?- run_diagnosis.
Follow the prompts to answer questions. The system will infer potential car problems based on your inputs and display results grouped by system area.

ðŸ§  System Features
âœ… Symptom-driven question flow
âœ… Intelligent skipping of unnecessary questions
âœ… Clear, grouped, human-readable diagnoses
âœ… Explanation module for every diagnosis
âœ… Easily extendable rule set
